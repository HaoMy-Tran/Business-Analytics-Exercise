## Part 4 – Business Insights

### 1. Two recommended actions to increase revenue
- **Leverage top-performing categories/products for upselling & cross-selling**  
  Focus marketing efforts on top categories. Launch targeted campaigns such as “complete the look” bundles or premium add-ons to boost average order value and strengthen customer stickiness.  

- **Balance revenue growth with profitability**  
  Not all top products yield the same margins. Prioritize promotions and inventory for high-margin products (high revenue and high profit) within these categories to ensure sustainable profit growth.  

### 2. One marketing opportunity for high-value customers
Insights show:  
- 70% of top customers are male  
- Over 30 years old  
- 30% based in China  
- 60% acquired via Search traffic  

**Opportunity:** Create a *personalized premium loyalty program* (early access to collections, exclusive previews, or men’s fashion bundles). Combine with targeted SEO/SEM campaigns to maximize engagement and revenue from this segment.  


### 3. One data gap to address before making decisions
- **Granularity of customer insights**: Current analysis is based on only the top 10 customers. A larger segment (e.g., top 5–10% by revenue) is needed for robust conclusions.  
- **Time-based category performance**: Fashion trends shift quickly. Performance should be analyzed over shorter intervals (monthly/quarterly) to distinguish sustainable growth drivers from seasonal spikes.
